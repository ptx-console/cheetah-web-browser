Cheetah is the result of the colaboration between GT Web Software and M. Firza Pratama. It is an attempt to combine the features of GTLite Navigator and Praken Surf, which are both very successful OpenWebKitSharp based Web Browsers.

Cheetah is based on Chromium/Awesomium 1.7, which means speed, security and stability. It is developed under .NET Framework 4.0 and is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8 32 and 64 Bit. Our aim is to provide a clear and easy-to-use application designed both for everyday internet users and also for web developers, providing a full featured HTML editor with live preview called Praken Note. In our goals is also to provide the ability to browse error-free in sites that take advantage of the new technologies (HTML5, CSS3 etc.)

The application is currently at early developing stages but is considered safe to be used as your everyday web browser.
